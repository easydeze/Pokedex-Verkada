# Pokedex-Verkada

# Milestone 1
For the first milestone, I started by calling the PokéAPI and testing the HTTP GET request to ensure I was able to fetch the Pokémon data using Postman. After I verified a successful connection, I then went into XCode and chose to utilize SwiftUI to first call the API with parameters that allowed me to fetch all of the Pokémon, then display it in a Grid. I chose to display the Pokémon by having three in each row to ensure visibility. Then I elected to have each Pokémon cell be a Button such that when a user clicks on the cell, it would trigger fetchPokemonDetails, which set the viewModel's selectedPokemon to be the Pokémon that was clicked on. Then the sprite would appear in the top center of the application, as per the instructions.
